I have 3 screenshots showing the same IGV reading just on different scales. They show the genomic region from Nothobranchius whitei chromosome 3. Blue tracks represent non-coding open chromatin regions (OCRs) from ATAC-seq. The red tracks show RNA expression levels. The purple arcs indicate chromatin loops from Hi-C data. Green annotations show gene locations. When used together there's potential for regulatory interactions between non-coding OCRs and nearby genes.
